    "  An important business strategy is to understand the factor that could be important for maximizing profit. One factor is location of business enterprise. The location of a business can influence the availability of demand and traffic of people seeking goods and services. Higher traffic can drive up the chance of increasing and maintaining profits. High demand of people correlates with location with higher population density. An example of a city with this high population density is New York city. New York city is one of the top ten cities in the world with the highest population density per square mile. New York city is considered the capital of the world, because of its unique multicultural population, and diverse business and entertainment enterprises. In this study, analysis of a good and service, the bakery industry, and the relationship of the population density in different neighborhoods, in the big Apple, are determined. The understanding of the relationship between these population density and the density of bakeries by neighborhood would enlighten business decision for potential stakeholders to determine what neighborhood's need for a particular good or service."

    "  The data used for the study were gotten from different sources and via different techniques. The population data, the regular and polygon geoJSON of New York city containing the Manhattan Borough by Neighbourhood were downloaded from the internet. While the data of the top places to go in Manhattan were scraped from the FourSquare site using the developer API access provided by signing up for a developer account with a radius of 500 and limit of 1000 places. The data were sorted and combined into one dataframe for analysis by venue category, bakery. There were some setbacks with the data in the final dataframe. There were some missing neighborhoods in the dataframe of the top places to go in Manhattan (which includes the data of bakeries) and the in the dataframe of the population data. There were some mismatched spelling and alphabetization in neighborhoods in both dataframes, which were edited to correct and match both dataframes for inner joining of the dataframe by the contents in the neighborhood column. About 14 neighborhoods were not present in the population dataframe. Only about 60% of the neighborhoods were matched in the final dataframe.\n"
